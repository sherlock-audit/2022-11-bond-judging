# Fixed-expiry bonds should only be deployed during bond or market creation

## Summary
Fixed-expiry bonds should only be deployed during bond or market creation.

## Vulnerability Detail
Right now, everyone can deploy any fixed-expiry bond contract (See BondFixedExpiryTeller.sol#L158-L163). However, the bond will only be minted during bond creation (See BondFixedExpiryTeller.sol#L126 and BondFixedExpiryTeller.sol#L131). Hence, It is better to deploy the bond during the creation to prevent too many contract addresses without any balance to be deployed.

## Impact
Too many fixed-expiry deployed bond contracts won't be created.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Replace these lines (See BondFixedExpiryTeller.sol#L107-L108) with
```solidity
if (bondToken == ERC20BondToken(address(0x00))) {
 deploy(underlying_, expiry_);
}
```
2. Do not allow any user to access this deploy function (See BondFixedExpiryTeller.sol#L158-L163) directly.  It is fine to allow other functions to call this function like what is suggested in 1 and the createMarket function(See BondFixedExpirySDA.sol#L46)

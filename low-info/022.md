# Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern not followed in BondBaseCallback

## Summary

The `withdraw()` function in the `BondBaseCallback` contract does not follow the checks-effects-interaction pattern.

## Vulnerability Detail

When withdrawing tokens from the `BondBaseCallback` contract, the checks-effects-interaction pattern is not followed, which could result in a reentrancy attack. In case the token is an ERC777 token masquerading as an ERC20 token, the recipient could reenter in the `withdraw()` function to withdraw additional tokens. 

As the `withdraw()` is able to withdraw all functions in one go, reentering has no additional benefit. Additionally, this function can only be successfully called by the contract owner.

## Impact

As this function is only accessible by the contract owner (thanks to the modifier) and you can drain the contract using this function anyway, the impact is considered low.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

First update the balance in the `priorBalances` mapping and afterwards send the tokens to the recipient:

```Solidity
function withdraw(
    address to_,
    ERC20 token_,
    uint256 amount_
) external onlyOwner {
    priorBalances[token_] = token_.balanceOf(address(this));
    token_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
}
```

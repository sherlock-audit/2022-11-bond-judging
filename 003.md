# Too many unnecessary new fixed-expiry bond contracts could be created

## Summary
Too many unnecessary new fixed-expiry bond contracts could be created.

## Vulnerability Detail
 (See `ERC20BondToken bondToken = bondTokens[underlying_][expiry_];`) Fixed-expiry bonds are differentiated by token type and expiry date. This means that there could be 86400 fixed-expiry bond addresses that could be created FOR EVERY SECOND in a day for an underlying token and this could be very inefficient (See BondFixedExpiryTeller.sol#L158-L184).

## Impact
Too many gases are spent to create too many new contracts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict only 1 new contract can be created for 1 underlying token in a day. Add the following code just before BondFixedExpiryTeller.sol#L168
```solidity
expiry_ = expiry_ / 1 days * 1 days;
```

# Debt Decay Faster Than Expected

## Summary

The debt decay at a rate faster than expected, causing market makers to sell bond tokens at a lower price than expected.  

## Vulnerability Detail

The following definition of the debt decay reference time following any purchases at time `t` taken from the whitepaper. The second variable, which is the delay increment, is rounded up. Following is taken from Page 15 of the whitepaper - Definition 27

However, the actual implementation in the codebase differs from the specification. At Line 514, the delay increment is rounded down instead.

```solidity
File: BondBaseSDA.sol
513:         // Set last decay timestamp based on size of purchase to linearize decay
514:         uint256 lastDecayIncrement = debtDecayInterval.mulDiv(payout_, lastTuneDebt);
515:         metadata[id_].lastDecay += uint48(lastDecayIncrement);
```

## Impact

When the delay increment (TD) is rounded down, the debt decay reference time increment will be smaller than expected. The debt component will then decay at a faster rate. As a result, the market price will not be adjusted in an optimized manner, and the market price will fall faster than expected, causing market makers to sell bond tokens at a lower price than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When computing the `lastDecayIncrement`, the result should be rounded up.

```diff
// Set last decay timestamp based on size of purchase to linearize decay
- uint256 lastDecayIncrement = debtDecayInterval.mulDiv(payout_, lastTuneDebt);
+ uint256 lastDecayIncrement = debtDecayInterval.mulDivUp(payout_, lastTuneDebt);
metadata[id_].lastDecay += uint48(lastDecayIncrement);
```

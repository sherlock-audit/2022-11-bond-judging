# Arbitrary Code Execution Within Callback Exposes Takers To Risk Of Being Compromised

## Summary

Arbitrary code execution within the callback might expose takers to the risk of being compromised if malicious code is inserted into the callback function.

## Vulnerability Detail

Bond Protocol allows whitelisted market makers to specify a custom callback contract when creating the market. The callback contract will be triggered when the takers purchase bond tokens.

The market makers can implement arbitrary code within the `_callback` function. A market maker can insert malicious code into the callback function (e.g. requesting token approval from users), which might allow the malicious maker to steal the assets from the users.

```solidity
File: BondSampleCallback.sol
34:     function _callback(
35:         uint256 id_,
36:         ERC20 quoteToken_,
37:         uint256 inputAmount_,
38:         ERC20 payoutToken_,
39:         uint256 outputAmount_
40:     ) internal override {
41:         // Transfer new payoutTokens to sender
42:         payoutToken_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, outputAmount_);
43:     }
```

## Impact

A market maker could insert malicious code into the callback function, exposing takers to the risk of their assets being stolen. Even if a market owner is trusted at this point in time, the owner could be compromised or turn rogue later.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider removing the callback feature from the protocol since the risk would likely outweigh the benefits. If users are being compromised due to the callback, the protocol team technically can blame it on the malicious market owner. However, in the real world, any bad news related to assets being stolen while using Bond Protocol, regardless it is the protocol or the market owner's fault, the protocol's reputation will be negatively affected. Most of the time, users who lose their funds due to a hack will always blame the protocol.

If that is not possible, instead of allowing whitelisted market makers to define arbitrary callback contract, a safer approach would be to implement an additional whitelisting mechanism to only allow callback contract that has completed a full audit to be added to the market.

Following are some of the security requirements that should be validated against the callback contract during an audit for reference:

- Immutable (Not upgradable)
- Does not contain self-destruct
- Does not perform delegate calls to external contract
- Should only contain the minimum code required for carrying out the transaction. No malicious code, such as requesting token approval from users

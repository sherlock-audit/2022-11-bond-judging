# Circuit breaker could cancel the last transaction to prevent an unnecessary loss

## Summary

In the protocol, the circuit breaker was introduced to suspend the market and protect the the market owners from a sudden lose in the extreme market conditions.
But the last transaction that triggered the circuit breaker is still processed and I believe this last transaction incurs loss of the owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `BondBaseSDA.sol#427`, the circuit breaker is triggered if the total debt is greater than the maximum debt of the market terms.

```solidity
function purchaseBond(
    uint256 id_,
    uint256 amount_,
    uint256 minAmountOut_
) external override returns (uint256 payout) {
    ...
    // Circuit breaker. If max debt is breached, the market is closed
    if (term.maxDebt < market.totalDebt) {//@audit-info totalDebt was updated in _decayAndGetPrice
        _close(id_);
    } else {
        // If market will continue, the control variable is tuned to to expend remaining capacity over remaining market duration
        _tune(id_, currentTime, price);
    }
}

```

And the total debt was updated in the function `_decayAndGetPrice` that is called at `BondBaseSDA.sol#398`.

```solidity
function _decayAndGetPrice(
    uint256 id_,
    uint256 amount_,
    uint48 time_
) internal returns (uint256 marketPrice_, uint256 payout_) {
    ...
    markets[id_].totalDebt =
        decayedDebt.mulDiv(debtDecayInterval, decayOffset + lastDecayIncrement) +
        payout_ +
        1; // add 1 to satisfy price inequality
}
```

It is possible to void the transaction early after this function returns. (not `revert` though because we need to close the market)

I don't see a reason of processing the transaction while it is clear that it is going to trigger the circuit breaker.

Although there are several additional options to limit the loss from one transaction (like `maxPayout`), I believe it is better to suspend the market when it's clear the total debt is going to be greater than the max debt.

## Impact

The market owner might get a loss that was possible to prevent by the protocol.

## Recommendation

Check the circuit breaker early after calling `_decayAndGetPrice` and void the transaction to prevent unnecessary loss for the market owner.

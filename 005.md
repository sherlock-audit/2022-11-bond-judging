# Close market should only be allowed if there is no bond token left in the teller contract

## Summary
Close market should only be allowed if there is no bond token left in the teller contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In this protocol, anyone can purchase bonds by supplying QuoteToken for BondToken. Once vested bondToken matured, it can be used to redeem the payoutToken. However, the market can be closed before all the bonds are redeemed.

## Impact
Although users are unable to mint tokens (which is correct), users can still be allowed to redeem tokens after closing the market. (See BondBaseSDA.sol#L371-L374, BondBaseSDA.sol#L428, and BondBaseSDA.sol#L439-L444). Technically, no activity should be allowed once the market is closed.

## Tool used
Manual Review and writing some test units.

## Recommendation
There is quite a lot of code refactoring that needs to be done. Below is the direction.

1. IBondTeller,  BondFixedExpiryTeller, and BondFixedTermTeller need to have a **new mapping integer variable**: bond minted quantity for every market id.
2. In BondFixedExpiryTeller and BondFixedTermTeller,  whenever the mint functions are called for the market id,  increase the integer variable; whenever the burn functions are called for the market id,  decrease the integer variable.
3. Ensure all the minted bond token is burned for the market id just before line BondBaseSDA.sol#L440, the code could look like this

```solidity
if(_teller.mintQtyById(id_) > 0) revert Auctioneer_MintQtyShouldBeZero();
```
[Note: Checking total supply is another way to ensure there is no bond left. However, the ERC1155 contract (See ERC1155.sol) does not have a total supply variable

# Functions in BondBaseCallback.sol would possibly let the hacker acquire the owner power

## Summary
In `bases/BondBaseCallback.sol`,  function `withdraw` and `deposit` would call functions `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` in `lib/TransferHelper.sol`, and finally call virtual function `transfer` and `transferFrom` in solmate library. However, when an `ERC20` token re-implements `transfer` and `transferFrom` function with a call back, and since `withdraw` and `deposit` do not have reentrancy protection, the owner power of Bond protocol would be taken to withdraw funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. `bases/BondBaseCallback.sol` imports the abstract contract `ERC20` from `solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol`, and using the library in `lib/TransferHelper.sol`;
2.  Function `withdraw` calls `token_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_)`,  and `deposit` calls `token_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount_)` in `lib/TransferHelper.sol`, and finally call virtual function `transfer` and `transferFrom` in solmate library;
3.  Thus, the `ERC20`  token could re-implements an evil callback in `transfer` and `transferFrom` function, doing exploitation using the owner permission of Bond protocol.

## Impact
Since function `withdraw` and `deposit` are executed onlyowner and without reentrancy protection, a hacker can re-implement a `ERC20`  token contract with a callback in `transfer` and `transferFrom` function to do exploitation using the owner power of Bond protocol.

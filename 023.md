# Read-only reentrancy in BondFixedTermTeller

## Summary

When minting new ERC1155 bonds in the `BondFixedTermTeller` contract, the total supply of this specific bond is updated after the new bonds are sent to the recipient, which introduces a reentrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever a new ERC1155 bond is minted in the `BondFixedTermTeller` contract, either through `_handlePayout()` or `create()`, the total supply is updated after the bond has been minted. 

ERC1155 tokens will perform a callback to the recipient in case the recipient implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface. Therefore, the recipient (`msg.sender` in `create()` or `recipient_` in `_handlePayout()` ) is able to perform a call to an arbitrary contract before the total supply of the bonds is updated.

While the recipient could enter the current `BondFixedTermTeller` contract to call any function, there is no interesting function which might result in financial loss in case it gets called in the callback. Alternatively, the recipient could enter a smart contract which uses the the public mapping `tokenMetadata` in `BondFixedTermTeller` to calculate the current bond price based on the supply. As the supply is not yet updated, but the tokens are minted, this might result in a miscalculation of the price.

## Impact

While the `BondFixedTermTeller` contract itself is not at risk, any protocols integrating with `BondFixedTermTeller` and using the total supply of the ERC1155 bond token to calculate the price, might come at risk.

## Recommendation

Update the total supply and mint the tokens afterwards:

```solidity
function _mintToken(
    address to_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 amount_
) internal {
    tokenMetadata[tokenId_].supply += amount_;
    _mint(to_, tokenId_, amount_, bytes(""));
}
```

# meta.tuneBelowCapacity param is not updated when BondBaseSDA.setIntervals is called

## Summary
When BondBaseSDA.setIntervals function is called then meta.tuneBelowCapacity param is not updated which has impact on price tuning.
## Vulnerability Detail
BondBaseSDA.setIntervals function allows for market owner to change some market interval. One of them is `meta.tuneInterval`.

```solidity
    function setIntervals(uint256 id_, uint32[3] calldata intervals_) external override {
        // Check that the market is live
        if (!isLive(id_)) revert Auctioneer_InvalidParams();


        // Check that the intervals are non-zero
        if (intervals_[0] == 0 || intervals_[1] == 0 || intervals_[2] == 0)
            revert Auctioneer_InvalidParams();


        // Check that tuneInterval >= tuneAdjustmentDelay
        if (intervals_[0] < intervals_[1]) revert Auctioneer_InvalidParams();


        BondMetadata storage meta = metadata[id_];
        // Check that tuneInterval >= depositInterval
        if (intervals_[0] < meta.depositInterval) revert Auctioneer_InvalidParams();


        // Check that debtDecayInterval >= minDebtDecayInterval
        if (intervals_[2] < minDebtDecayInterval) revert Auctioneer_InvalidParams();


        // Check that sender is market owner
        BondMarket memory market = markets[id_];
        if (msg.sender != market.owner) revert Auctioneer_OnlyMarketOwner();


        // Update intervals
        meta.tuneInterval = intervals_[0];
        meta.tuneIntervalCapacity = market.capacity.mulDiv(
            uint256(intervals_[0]),
            uint256(terms[id_].conclusion) - block.timestamp
        ); // don't have a stored value for market duration, this will update tuneIntervalCapacity based on time remaining
        meta.tuneAdjustmentDelay = intervals_[1];
        meta.debtDecayInterval = intervals_[2];
    }
```
`meta.tuneInterval` has impact on `meta.tuneIntervalCapacity`. That means that when you change tuning interval you also change the capacity that is operated during tuning.
There is also one more param that depends on this, but is not counted here.

This is `meta.tuneBelowCapacity` param and it is needed to say if the market has overselled tokens. In another words it says if `meta.tuneIntervalCapacity` is already sold. This param is checked while tuning and then is updated after the tuning.

```solidity
        if (
            (market.capacity < meta.tuneBelowCapacity && timeNeutralCapacity < initialCapacity) ||
            (time_ >= meta.lastTune + meta.tuneInterval && timeNeutralCapacity > initialCapacity)
        ) {
            // Calculate the correct payout to complete on time assuming each bond
            // will be max size in the desired deposit interval for the remaining time
            //
            // i.e. market has 10 days remaining. deposit interval is 1 day. capacity
            // is 10,000 TOKEN. max payout would be 1,000 TOKEN (10,000 * 1 / 10).
            markets[id_].maxPayout = capacity.mulDiv(uint256(meta.depositInterval), timeRemaining);


            // Calculate ideal target debt to satisty capacity in the remaining time
            // The target debt is based on whether the market is under or oversold at this point in time
            // This target debt will ensure price is reactive while ensuring the magnitude of being over/undersold
            // doesn't cause larger fluctuations towards the end of the market.
            //
            // Calculate target debt from the timeNeutralCapacity and the ratio of debt decay interval and the length of the market
            uint256 targetDebt = timeNeutralCapacity.mulDiv(
                uint256(meta.debtDecayInterval),
                uint256(meta.length)
            );


            // Derive a new control variable from the target debt
            uint256 controlVariable = terms[id_].controlVariable;
            uint256 newControlVariable = price_.mulDivUp(market.scale, targetDebt);


            emit Tuned(id_, controlVariable, newControlVariable);


            if (newControlVariable < controlVariable) {
                // If decrease, control variable change will be carried out over the tune interval
                // this is because price will be lowered
                uint256 change = controlVariable - newControlVariable;
                adjustments[id_] = Adjustment(change, time_, meta.tuneAdjustmentDelay, true);
            } else {
                // Tune up immediately
                terms[id_].controlVariable = newControlVariable;
                // Set current adjustment to inactive (e.g. if we are re-tuning early)
                adjustments[id_].active = false;
            }


            metadata[id_].lastTune = time_;
            metadata[id_].tuneBelowCapacity = market.capacity > meta.tuneIntervalCapacity
                ? market.capacity - meta.tuneIntervalCapacity
                : 0;
            metadata[id_].lastTuneDebt = targetDebt;
        }
```

If you don't update `meta.tuneBelowCapacity` when changing intervals you have a risk, that price will not be tuned when tuneIntervalCapacity was decreased or it will be still tuned when tuneIntervalCapacity was increased.

As a result tuning will not be completed when needed.

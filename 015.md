# Race condition on `ERC20BondToken` approval

## Summary

The `approve()` function, which is used to manage allowances, exposes the users of the `ERC20BondToken` token to frontrunning attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ERC20BondToken` inherits from `CloneERC20`. The `CloneERC20` implements the following `approve` function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bond/blob/main/src/lib/CloneERC20.sol#L49

```solidity
File: CloneERC20.sol
49:     function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
50:         allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
51: 
52:         emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
53: 
54:         return true;
55:     }
```

Note that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. Reference: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/b2970b96e5e2be297421cd7690e3502e49f7deff/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L57.

Following is the possible attack scenario taken from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/

> 1. Alice allows Bob to transfer `N` of Alice's tokens (`N > 0`) by calling the approve method on a Token smart contract, passing the Bob's address and `N` as the method arguments
> 2. After some time, Alice decides to change from `N` to `M` (`M > 0`) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the approve method again, this time passing the Bob's address and `M` as the method arguments
> 3. Bob notices the Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the transferFrom method to transfer `N` Alice's tokens somewhere
> 4. If the Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then     Bob will successfully transfer `N` Alice's tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another `M` tokens
> 5. Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the transferFrom method again, this time to transfer `M` Alice's tokens.
>
> So, an Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from `N` to `M` (`N > 0` and `M > 0`) made it possible for Bob to transfer (`N + M`) of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.

## Impact

The token is not guarded against approval front-running attacks. If the `approve` function is called twice, an attacker can perform a front-run attack and double spend, resulting in a loss of assets for the victim.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Following are some of the possible solutions to mitigate the issue

1. Implement functions similar to OpenZeppelin’s increaseAllowance or decreaseAllowance

2. Reduce the spender’s allowance to 0. Subsequently, set the spender's allowance to the desired value. Reference: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
3. Preventing a call to approve if all the previous tokens are not spent by adding a check that the allowed balance is 0: `require(allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == 0)`.

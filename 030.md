# Fixed Term Markets can be created with 1 day vesting, even though docs specify 3 day minimum

## Summary

In the docs, it specifies that markets should have a minimum of 3 day vesting to ensure that token prices aren't pushed down by users dumping. However, in the code, this minimum is set to only 1 day.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `BondFixedTermSDA.sol`, the `createMarket()` function is implemented, which decodes and validates the parameters to create a new market on an auctioneer.

```solidity
function createMarket(bytes calldata params_) external override returns (uint256) {
    // Decode params into the struct type expected by this auctioneer
    MarketParams memory params = abi.decode(params_, (MarketParams));

    // Check that the vesting parameter is valid for a fixed-term market
    if (params.vesting != 0 && (params.vesting < 1 days || params.vesting > MAX_FIXED_TERM))
        revert Auctioneer_InvalidParams();

    // Create market and return market ID
    return _createMarket(params);
}
```
In the docs, the minimum vesting period is stated to be 3 days, but in the code above, we only check to ensure that the vesting parameter is greater than or equal to `1 days`.

## Impact

Issuers will be able to create markets with a 1 day vesting period, which is less than the minimum the Bond Protocol team has determined to avoid creating too much sell pressure on their payout token.

## Recommendation

Increase the minimum vesting to 3 days:

```solidity
if (params.vesting != 0 && (params.vesting < 3 days || params.vesting > MAX_FIXED_TERM))
...

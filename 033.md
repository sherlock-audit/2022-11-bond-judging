# Lack of events for critical arithmetic parameters

## Summary
Function `BondBaseSDA.setDefaults` sets critical arithmetic parameters for bond market. But it has no event emitted, it is difficult to track these critical changes off-chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `bases/BondBaseSDA`, critical parameters are set and changed in function `BondBaseSDA.setDefaults` for bond market.

However, no event is emitted, and it is difficult to track these critical changes off-chain.  Both Users and Issuers would possibly be unware of  these changes.

## Impact
Both Users and Issuers would possibly be unware of  critical changes on bond market.

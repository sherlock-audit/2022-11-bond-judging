# A whitelisted address can DoS most `view` methods in `BondAggregator`

## Summary
A malicious/compromised account that is whitelisted in `BondAggregator` can create an infinite amount of markets, resulting in the `view` methods being in a state of DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
Any whitelisted account can call `registerMarket()` as much times as he wants, only paying for gas. If the argument values are always the same, the method will push a new `marketId` in the `marketsForPayout` and `marketsForQuote` arrays on each call, which arrays are iterated over when calling `liveMarketsBetween()` or `liveMarketsFor()` or `marketsFor()` or `findMarketFor()`. If any of the arrays gets too big, the gas cost to iterate over it will be more than the block gas limit, so the view functions will always revert since they can't be included in a block, essentially resulting in a state of DoS for them.

## Impact
The impact is a state of DoS for protocol's functionality, that can be used by on-chain integrated protocols or front ends. Since this requires a malicious/compromised whitelisted account I think Medium severity is appropriate

## Recommendation
Limit the times a whitelisted account can call the `registerMarket()` functionality, for example to 50 or 100 times per account.

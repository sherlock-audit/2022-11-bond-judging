# _tune() uses incorrect initialCapacity

## Summary

When a market is tuned in `_tune()`, part of the calculation is the `initialCapacity` (standardized to payout token). If the market capacity is measured in quote token, this is calculated by adding current capacity to the product of the amount purchased by the current price. This calculation could be off by quite a bit if the current price is not representative of the past prices at which the tokens were purchased.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `BondBaseSDA.sol`, the `_tune()` function is used to update the market parameters if the market is oversold or undersold.

In order for these calculations to work correctly, we must calculate the `initialCapacity` of payout tokens.

```solidity
// Standardize capacity into an payout token amount
uint256 capacity = market.capacityInQuote
    ? market.capacity.mulDiv(market.scale, price_)
    : market.capacity;

// Calculate initial capacity based on remaining capacity and amount sold/purchased up to this point
uint256 initialCapacity = capacity +
    (market.capacityInQuote ? market.purchased.mulDiv(market.scale, price_) : market.sold);
```
In the situation where the market capacity is measured in the quote token, this calculation boils down to:

```solidity
market.capacity.mulDiv(market.scale, price_) + market.purchased.mulDiv(market.scale, price_)
```
The current capacity in this calculation is correct, but the past capacity assumes that the previously purchased tokens were sold at the current price. This likely is not the case.

In situations where the current price is extremely high or low, this calculation has the potential to largely overestimate or underestimate the initial capacity of the token provided.

## Impact

Incorrect tuning parameters may lead to incorrectly assigned control variables and adjustments, which could throw off the prices of future bond purchases.

## Recommendation

Two options I can see:
1) Save `initialCapacity` up front to ensure these calculations are happening with the correct value.
2) Instead of standardizing capacity to the payment token, split `_tune()` to perform the calculations in whichever token capacity is stored in.

# Bond market won't be created if it was registered separately earlier before

## Summary
The bond market won't be created if it was registered separately earlier before.

## Vulnerability Detail
The bond market needs to have a `conclusion` (See BondBaseSDA.sol#L395) value that is smaller than the current block time in order for the purchaser to participate. However, if the bond market is registered separately from the market creation, there is **NO** logic in the entire codebase that allows the `conclusion` value to be set. The only logic in the codebase that set the `conclusion` value (See iBondBaseSDA.sol#L288) is during the market creation which comes together with market registration.

## Impact
The bond market which was registered separately from creation will not be used forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Disallow registerMarket (See BondAggregator.sol#L75-L88) to be called by anyone. Only allow it to be called from `createMarket` function (See BondBaseSDA.sol#L167)

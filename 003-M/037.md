# [NAZ-M1] `referrer_ && Protocol` Can Front run `purchase()` To Collect Additional Fees Up To `minAmountOut_`

## Summary
`purchase()` is a function used to exchange quote tokens for a bond in a specified market and pay fees to both a referrer and protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The parameter `minAmountOut_` in the function `purchase()` is meant to prevent frontrunning. However, if a user sets `minAmountOut_` to a low amount, `referrer_ && Protocol` can still frontrun the purchaser to up their fees to collect more.

## Impact
1. Alice wants to purchase a bond. She calls `purchase()` from the frontend with Mallory as the `referrer_`.
2. Mallory sees this and also notices that Alice has used a low `minAmountOut_`. So she frontruns Alice to up her `referrerFees`.
3. Alice's purchase still goes through but has had to paid more fees then expected.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a timelock to both `setReferrerFee() && setProtocolFee()`.

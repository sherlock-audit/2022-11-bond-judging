# When purchasing a fixed-expiry bond with no expiry / vesting, payoutToken could be burned if the recipient is set to address 0

## Summary
When purchasing a fixed-expiry bond with no expiry / vesting, payoutToken could be burned if the recipient is set to address(0).

## Vulnerability Detail
Added a custom test (See MyTest1.t.sol#L196-L237) to verify this. 

```solidity
teller.purchase(address(0), referrer, id, bondAmount, 0);
```

(See MyTest1.t.sol#L226) can be executed without error If the vesting / expiry (See MyTest1.t.sol#L131) is set to 0. Then, the payoutToken is sent to address 0 (See BondFixedTermTeller.sol#L90, MyTest1.t.sol#L216 and MyTest1.t.sol#L227) after purchase is made.
 
## Impact
ERC20 token which does not have a burn function treats sending tokens to address 0 as burn. Therefore, I would say PayoutToken will get burned if the user accidentally passes in address 0 as the recipient.

## Tool used
Manual Review and added a foundry test (See MyTest1.t.sol#L196-L237)

## Recommendation
Add         
```solidity
if(recipient_ == address(0)) {
  revert Teller_InvalidParams();
}
```

This can prevent the recipient to set as address 0.

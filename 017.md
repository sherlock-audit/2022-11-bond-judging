# Rounding Issue In Control Variable

## Summary

The rounding error when computing the control variable causes the control variable to be lower, leading to the makers selling tokens at a lower price than expected, as the market price of a token is computed as a product of the control variable and debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

The computed control variable at Line 600 is rounded up to achieve the desirable property that the integer implementation of the control variable will be greater than or equal to the real value of the control variable. This ensures that the integer implementation of the price calculated from `controlVariable * debt` will be greater than or equal to the real value of the price, which protects makers from selling tokens at a lower price than expected.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bond/blob/main/src/bases/BondBaseSDA.sol#L598

```solidity
File: BondBaseSDA.sol
598:             // Derive a new control variable from the target debt
599:             uint256 controlVariable = terms[id_].controlVariable;
600:             uint256 newControlVariable = price_.mulDivUp(market.scale, targetDebt);
```

However, this is not consistently applied throughout the codebase. In the following code, the control variable is rounded down, which will result in the integer implementation of the control variable to be lower than the real value of the control variable. This, in turn, leads to the makers selling tokens at a lower price than expected.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bond/blob/main/src/bases/BondBaseSDA.sol#L280

```solidity
File: BondBaseSDA.sol
280:         // price = control variable * debt / scale
281:         // therefore, control variable = price * scale / debt
282:         uint256 controlVariable = params_.formattedInitialPrice.mulDiv(scale, targetDebt);
```

## Impact

The market price of a token is computed as a product of the control variable and debt. If the control variable is lower than expected, the tokens will be sold at a lower price than expected, leading to a loss for the market makers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the rounding is consistently applied throughout the codebase when computing the control variable so that the desired property can be achieved.

```diff
- uint256 controlVariable = params_.formattedInitialPrice.mulDiv(scale, targetDebt);
+ uint256 controlVariable = params_.formattedInitialPrice.mulDivUp(scale, targetDebt);
```

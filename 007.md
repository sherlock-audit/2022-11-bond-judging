# Referral system allows user to buy at a discount

## Summary
The referrer is a user-provided value. They can simply use their own address to buy at a discount.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anybody can be a referrer. A user can set themselves as a referrer with the highest possible fee (`5e3`) and buy tokens at a discount.

## Impact
A small loss of funds per purchase per user.

## Code Snippet

The [`setReferrerFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bond/blob/main/src/bases/BondBaseTeller.sol#L88-L91) function is permissionless. Anybody can register as a referrer:
```sol
    function setReferrerFee(uint48 fee_) external override nonReentrant {
        if (fee_ > 5e3) revert Teller_InvalidParams();
        referrerFees[msg.sender] = fee_;
    }
``` 

When making a purchase, they use their own address as the referrer to get a discount: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bond/blob/main/src/bases/BondBaseTeller.sol#L137

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You could make the referrer map permissioned so that only specific addresses are allowed (frontends). The user could then choose from them when they interact with the contract directly.

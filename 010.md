# BondAggregator.liveMarketsBy eventually will revert because of block gas limit

## Summary
BondAggregator.liveMarketsBy eventually will revert because of block gas limit
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bond/blob/main/src/BondAggregator.sol#L259-L280
```solidity
    function liveMarketsBy(address owner_) external view returns (uint256[] memory) {
        uint256 count;
        IBondAuctioneer auctioneer;
        for (uint256 i; i < marketCounter; ++i) {
            auctioneer = marketsToAuctioneers[i];
            if (auctioneer.isLive(i) && auctioneer.ownerOf(i) == owner_) {
                ++count;
            }
        }


        uint256[] memory ids = new uint256[](count);
        count = 0;
        for (uint256 i; i < marketCounter; ++i) {
            auctioneer = marketsToAuctioneers[i];
            if (auctioneer.isLive(i) && auctioneer.ownerOf(i) == owner_) {
                ids[count] = i;
                ++count;
            }
        }


        return ids;
    }
```
BondAggregator.liveMarketsBy function is looping through all markets and does at least `marketCounter` amount of external calls(when all markets are not live) and at most 4 * `marketCounter` external calls(when all markets are live and owner matches. This  all consumes a lot of gas, even that is called from view function. And each new market increases loop size.

That means that after some time `marketsToAuctioneers` mapping will be big enough that the gas amount sent for view/pure function will be not enough to retrieve all data(50 million gas according to [this](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/9824/can-solidity-view-pure-functions-be-arbitrarily-complex)). So the function will revert.

Also similar problem is with `findMarketFor`, `marketsFor` and `liveMarketsFor` functions.
## Impact
Functions will always revert and whoever depends on it will not be able to get information.

## Recommendation
Remove not active markets or some start and end indices to functions.
